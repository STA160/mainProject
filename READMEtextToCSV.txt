How to run the script to read in all of the text files:

python congTextToCSV.pu [path to the folder with the text files] [Path to two files: get from google drive]

Example: python congTextToCSV.py textData legislators-current.json.txt legislators-historical.json.txt

Make sure to have the script cong_record_processer.py in the same folder.

Feel free to change anything in either file to make it faster.
